## Thoughts 37Signals Shape-up model 
_from the perspective of a squad leader_

We are nearing the end of our 2nd cycle of completion of our refined approach of the Shape-up model we have been exploring this year.  I will preface this with I speak solely for my opinions and if you have your thoughts and experiences, I encourage you to contribute to the discussion.  I won't preface any more than that, so read with that in mind.  

### What were the goals
#### Get focus time on projects we want to complete
We have had a few projects launched that we wish to launch that did not get focus or time investment. We wish they could have.  In the previous model, it was challenging to get dedicated people or time for projects to be developed. This resulted in individual efforts or many start-stops. 

#### Intermingle individuals across teams
Since the teams started as infrastructure support.  There was not a lot of mixing of work, so teams did not naturally collaborate.  The mix-up of the squad model moved people around, with each squad coming from those 2 big business lines, working together to form new relationships and natural collaboration. 

#### Better scoping and requirements setting
The Shape-up model was to enable a pipeline of preventer work based on research and collaboration of the team managers + technical product manager. The idea being to build a flow of work of important with a defined scope to reduce risk of trying to take on too much. 
 
 #### Better project visibility and status
Using hill charts and weekly team huddles / project status meetings provide more insight into project status. This would create accountability, while also highlighting potential bottlenecks or hang-ups in the development of assigned “bet” 
 
#### Break out of the 2w sprint model of doing work
Moving to monthly cycles to complete work breaks the typical sprint patter, though teams, squads could still implement that pattern if they felt it was effective.  The focus was not on sprint goals, but on doing everything possible to meet the “bet” goals laid out before the team.  

#### Rotate squads across projects 
This was an original goal discussed to “share knowledge” give different experiences.  I am not sure if this is still an active plan as I have not heard anything more recently about this goal. 

### So where are we 
There are a few good things and areas we should draw up differently. 

Let's start positive first:
#### The Good 
* Project focus time and writing down what we intend to do.  Getting dedicated people rallied around a single set of goals within a domain was and is effective.  This was a good output of the experiment, once a team was ramped up on a project idea, they could move quickly to execute, even faster as expertise grew.  This is a by product of the experiment, not directly caused by Shape-up itself, but an excellent one. 

* Breaking out of the 2w sprint / scrum workflow.  Allowing teams to set their check-ins, assign work internally, and allow for flexibility within a given timeframe allows for time and energy to be focused on goals and work vs. process.  There is more individual ownership as they can focus on completing as much as they can in a month instead of doing arbitrary estimates of individual tasks, which outside of Tax purposes are meaningless.  Estimating engineering work is difficult, breaking it down before you understand the problem is hard enough (Change my mind).  

* Drafting "bets", "pitches", and any other related discussion materials.  The Shape-model provides a framework for setting up a project that is mostly a win.  The benefit of the experiment so far is having something grounding at the beginning to target and discuss.  The one “watch out” here is making sure that the initial planning / discussion document, not a strict battle plan.  As expertise on the project and domain is increased by the team, there has to be room to adjust, even if not necessarily spelled out initially in the pitch.  This is the definition of agile engineering, continued rapid iterations as currently held assumptions are invalidated, or new solutions present themselves in the act of problem-solving. 

#### The Not so good
* Missing cooldown / wrap up period, in our efforts to not force people to be in support for more than 30 days this seems to be chopped from the model.  This is in the Shape-up model, perhaps one of the more appealing parts of it.  They have 6w of on-time, then 2w of freedom, called a cooldown.  In our model we have 4w cycle with no cooldown.  I understand the reason is to rotate off support.  Moving into support seems difficult, as the squad leaving has to quickly transfer knowledge of current problems and switch gears while the incoming team has little time to ramp up. Active project has to drop for at least a month of time.  

* Project visibility, Hill charts, is overthinking project tracking and communication.  It's a pretty graph with many subjective points along a line chart that attempts to tell how far along the process of shipping something is.  I can not really see how this would be used in practice to change the direction of work or project.  It is busy work that someone has to do to determine a place on a line chart for someone else to review that rarely will.  Just keep it simple, we have a tiny user base in comparison to a product like basecamp (that is context, not an argument itself). Why not the old easy system on an issue basis - (backlog) maybe do someday, (to do) going to do, (in progress) doing it, (shipped) is done? If a squad wants to go levels in-between, that's up to them. Project status is just a summation of how many items will be shipped before whatever deadline is set.  

* The nomenclature just feels unnecessary, and frankly I don't like it.  I do not understand the need to apply new terminology for words that already exist and are used commonly inside and outside the company.  Why can't we just call things projects, features, bugs, proposals, as they are widely understood and accepted?  Possibly if the entire company made a culture decision to move to the language, like in the case with 37Signals and had someone like DHH forcing them to conform, then let's do it, otherwise let's skip it.  (Nitpicky I know)

#### The Mixed 

* Intermingling of squads, this is both good and bad.  I think it is great that new people have got to work together and there is more diverse knowledge of brands across squads.  All that is good and beneficial to the team as a whole.  Now, on the not so great side, the internal platform channel has effectively died as individual squad channels became the norm for communication between individuals.  New silos formed, as this is natural for people working closely on the same problem will have more to communicate with and debate/discuss.  Is this bad?  IIt seems difficult to avoid, and maybe not worth trying to combat. Small teams doing things is the fastest way to move. The argument is everyone should be able to support everything we build.  I think there are layers to that.  Yes, people should be able to plug in and understand or get up to speed on due to shared knowledge of language, toolkit, and approach.
I just thing it takes experience being on a project to be able to fully support it deeply, so it's muddy for sure.  Teams should be responsible for supporting anything deeper than surface level questions

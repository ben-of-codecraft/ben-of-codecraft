## About Me 
<span style="font-size:23px; display: inline-block; padding-right:6px">⛰️</span> I work from the serene landscapes of rural Virginia. 

<div style="font-size:20px; display: inline-block; padding-right:14px">👨‍👩‍👧</div>I have a loving family, which includes my wonderful wife, two daughters, and a lively menagerie of five cats and three dogs.

<div style="font-size:20px; display: inline-block; padding-right:10px">🎮</div> I'm an avid gamer, drawn to games that allow me to build and engage in theorycrafting. 

<div style="font-size:20px; display: inline-block; padding-right:10px">💪</div> I pretend I can get back into shape using a peloton and free weight gym. 

<div style="font-size:22px; display: inline-block; padding-right:10px">👨‍💻</div>  I have been addicted to writing code and learning new frameworks in building software for the last 20 years. 

## 
Currently, I'm honing my programming skills, particularly in cloud development, after a brief hiatus. I'm cautiously optimistic about the transformative impact of AI-driven technology on our lives. 

###  My Interests




 Feel free to connect with me; I'd be delighted to engage with fellow tech enthusiasts like you.

I euphoria and frustrations that come with being directly involved with designing software. I am sure I will update this space 
more with new projects and endeavors. 

I like to keep my profile pic updated with art from my 11 year old daughter (who seems to have a knack for digital art) below is the archive of photos that have been on 
display.

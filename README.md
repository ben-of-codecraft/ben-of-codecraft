### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a tech leader dropout, as I missed the euphoria and frustrations that come with being directly involved with designing software. I am sure I will update this space 
more with new projects and endeavors. 

I like to keep my profile pic updated with art from my 11 year old daughter (who seems to have a knack for digital art) below is the archive of photos that have been on 
display.
